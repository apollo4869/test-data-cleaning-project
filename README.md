# Learning Summary: The First Step in Data Scienceâ€”Data Cleaning

## The Necessity of Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is undoubtedly the first step in data science, and its importance cannot be overstated.

The primary goal of data cleaning is to ensure **consistency** and **completeness** of the data. Models require data to have a uniform format for efficient batch processing; otherwise, the models may fail to run or produce inaccurate predictions. Whether it is a simple regression model or a complex deep learning model, proper data cleaning is an indispensable step.

## Characteristics of Data Cleaning
From this project, I recognized three distinct characteristics of data cleaning:
1. **Large Volume of Data**: A large amount of data must be processed efficiently using programming tools such as Python, as manual cleaning is infeasible.
2. **High Complexity**: Data may come from multiple sources, include different data types (e.g., numerical, textual, timestamps), and lack a unified format, requiring tailored cleaning strategies.
3. **Serious Data Quality Issues**: Data often contains missing values, outliers, and duplicates, which, if not handled, can significantly impact subsequent analysis and modeling.

## Practice and Reflection in This Project
In this small project, I applied the most basic and conventional data cleaning methods:
- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Columns with excessive missing values were directly removed.
  - For columns with moderate missing values, the median or mean was used to fill in the gaps.
- **Handling Outliers**:
  - Outliers were visualized using boxplots and handled using the IQR method by either removing or replacing extreme values.

These methods are simple and effective for beginners but have certain limitations:
- Removing missing values may lead to information loss.
- Filling missing values with simple statistical measures may fail to reflect the true distribution of the data.

## Gains and Understanding
1. The complexity of data cleaning lies not in the methods themselves but in determining the most appropriate cleaning strategy based on the target task and model requirements.
2. Python is a powerful tool for data cleaning, with its rich libraries (e.g., Pandas and NumPy) providing flexible and efficient solutions.
3. Through hands-on practice, I have developed a clear understanding of the data cleaning process and the critical role data quality plays in subsequent model training.

## Future Plans
Through this project, I have realized that data cleaning is only the starting point of data science. In the future, I plan to:
1. Learn more advanced cleaning techniques, such as interpolation and model-based imputations.
2. Explore feature engineering and data preprocessing methods for model training.
3. Build simple machine learning models (e.g., linear regression or decision trees) to further explore the relationship between data and models.

## Conclusion
This project marks an important step in my journey into data science, helping me deeply understand the principle that "data cleaning is the foundation, and quality determines success." Moving forward, I will continue to explore more advanced cleaning methods and analytical techniques to enhance my skills.
